This is a kaggle competition for [Airbnb New User Prediciton](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings). 
# Business Problem
Airbnb wants to preduct the first destination a new user would book. By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking and better forecast demand.
# Define it as a ML problem
This is a multiclass classification problem. A user can choose from 10 destinations. We want to predict the most probable 5 destinations.
